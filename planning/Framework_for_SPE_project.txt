Framework for SPE project

1. Create an ANN or Response Surface for designing/optimizing a frack job
- we will choose one after lit review

2. Include uncertainty in the model - ie. multiple realizations - give a probabilistic estimate

3. What features to look at?
- fluid + completions + rock
- 

4. Input
    - frack type
    - tonnage per meter
    - length of well
    - stage spacing
    - lat/long/depth
        - uncertainty analysis around this
    - initial flow backs
        - feature creation based on the flow back data
        - rate of flow back / waiting time --> how to quantify uncertainty and the effect on end production
        - % of cumulative fluid pumped based on the amount flowed back
    - rock props
        - uncertain in the play
    - frack fluid
        - viscosity

4. Outputs to look at?
- IP 90
- IP 180
- Cumulatives after 12-18 months
- Lit review: CGR?

5. git repository:

https://github.com/chews0n/glowing-waffle

6. start with a small lit review
-

7. Data? -> grab something from AccuMap or otherwise? 
- Dependant on features
- Keep it to the last four years
- Ensure variability in the data, but not too unrealistic for current frack jobs

8. validation -> either compare to a simulator or use another data set that wasn't used in training or both 

8. End Product should be somewhat universal -> probably require retraining for different plays (eg. marcellus vs bakken vs montney)
