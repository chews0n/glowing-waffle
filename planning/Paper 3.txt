Paper 3: Efficient Use of Data Analytics in Optimization of Hydraulic Fracturing in Unconventional Reservoirs

Notes:
- RSM is a compromise between cost and time compared to other models
- Focus' primarily on the physics of the fractures
- Utilized a commercial simulator to provide a response surface on the effects of the variable
- Importance of features is below

Inputs:
- Fracture Half Length (2)
- Litfetime PI ratio (1)
- Fracture Height (6) 
- Fracture Top (4)
- Fracture Bottom (3)
- Payzone Coverage Ratio (7)
- Average Fracture Conductivity (9)
- Average Propant Concentration (10)
- Slurry Volume (8)
- Praoppant Total (5)

Outputs:
- Cummulative Production
