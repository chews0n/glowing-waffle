Paper 1: Data-driven model for hydraulic fracturing design optimization: 
focus on building digital database and production forecas

Notes:
- Problem --> What is the optimum set of fracturing design parameters, which for a given set of resevoir characterization-well parameters yield an optimum pos-fracturing production?
- Recommendations expected form the study:
	- Oil production  forecast based on the welland the resevoir layer
	- Optimum frac design
	- Data aquisition systems
- Linear models and ANN's sensitive to sparse data. ANN prone to overfitting
- Decision trees are not as senstive to sparse/field data
- SVM'shave large list of parameters and are prone to over-fitting
- Paper mentionshow multiple other studies have used small data samples so their needs to be more testing to determine if the models are predictive
- Overfitting a realproblem in the process
- Overfitting - negative phenomenon that occurs when the learning algorithm generates a model that provides predictions mimicking a training dataset too accurately, but have very innaccurate data on test data
	- Occam Razor: The models include more terms and variables than necessary. (ie.More complex than necessary)
	- Small datasets
	- Too many parameters --> choose parameters based on test set performance
	- Bad statistics (ie. known confidence)
	- Incorrect target variable or incorrect representations (ie. inputs already contain target variable)
	- Human-loop (ie. Human error as we make the decision to design)
	- Bad/irrelevant data
	- Review - ie.only using one data source leading to a narrow view
- Example form other study: 289 wells vs 178 features. The number of data points it to smallfor the number of features, so a sufficienlty complex model will just remmeber the dataset and not provide predictions
- Tree based modelsfor identifying features of zero importance
	- Boruta Method
	- Sobol Method
	- OVAT - Used in the paper, not for identifying feature importance but for target value sensitivity to variation
- CatBoost performed the best with 35-50 inputs
	- R2 of 0.815

Inputs --> Resevoir, well/geomechanics, and frac job design
- 35-50 inputs. These were the most important
	- Number of stages
	- Propant mass per meter of perforated interval
	- Volume of injected fluid
	- Resevoir Net Pay
	- Perforation TVD
	- Perf angle
	- Geological Facies Type
	- Resevoir Layer
	- Perf Interval
	- Permeability

Outputs --> Production
- 16 outputs
	- Cum Prod 3 and 18 month most important

Models:
- SVM - negative R2
- KNN
- ANN - negative R2
- Decision Trees
- Ensembles based on Decision Trees
	- CatBoost - performed the best
