SPE 189823 ML Applied to Optimize Duvernay Well Performance

Goal: Optimize Completions and Well Design
Models: Multiple Linear Regression and Neural Network
Sample Size: 262 Duvernay Wells - Dry Gas to Volatile Oil 10x10 townships
	12 months of public production
	Mapped initial condensate yield <500 bbl/MMcf -> gas rate used as an indication of relative performance
Model: Able to predict 78% of variance in well performance on 52 well test set

Target Variable: Cumulative Volume on individual well compared to the cumulative volume of a type curve
for the length of producing time of the individual well. Type curve calculated to methodology in SPE-174784
(ML as a Reliable Technology for Evaluating Time-Rate Performance of Unconventional Wells)
	Cumulative gas of well / cumulative volume of type curve

	Hybrid Frac %
	Plug and Perf (Y/N)
	Avg Pump Rate
	% Resin
	%Ceramic
	% 100 Mesh
	Max Prop Conc
	Avg Perf Clusters
	Acid Volume Pumped
	Stand Alone (No wells closer than 800m)
	Infill Well (Drilled after well <800m)
	Interior Well

	TVD
	Extreme Completion Problem (Unable to mill out well)


Conclusions No benefit from:
	 ceramic or resin coated proppant
	Hybrid Fluid Systems
	Placing wells on azimuth
Total Tonnage Key driver
