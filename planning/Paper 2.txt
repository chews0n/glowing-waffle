Paper 2 - Insights to fracture stimulation design in unconventional reservoirs based onmachine learning modeling

Notes:
- Western Canada Sed Basin - Montney
- Important to state geological properties, something that has been overlooked in many earlier studies
- Fewer,most important parameters are necessary
- Model's are a critical,difficult taskin choosing.
	- SVM good for small datasets
	- RF require more datasets, but will be more robust
	- NN require large amounts of data to work and is tedious/time consuming
- Focusing on first year well production with stimulation design
- Used a database from geoLogic Systems
- Had limited access to the geological properties of the formation (permeability, porosity, resevoir pressure, initial water, geothermal gradient)
- Relied on data sccessible (well location, lat/long, TVD) to indirectly represent geological differences


Inputs:
- Lat (deg)
- Long (deg)
- TVD (m)
- Lat Length (m)
- Well Completion Type (cased hole/open hole)
- Well Bore direction (E/W, NE/SW, N/S, NW/SE)
- Total Proppant (ton)
- Total Fracturing Fluid (m3)
- Fracture Stages
- Use of interval Clusters
- 12 month BOE (mbo)

Outputs:
- 12 month BOE (mbo)

Model:
- Random Forest (RF) - Performed the best
- Adaptive Boosting (AdBoost)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (NN)
